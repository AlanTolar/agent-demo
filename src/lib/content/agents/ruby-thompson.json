  "bio": "I got into the land real estate industry about 10 years ago after starting out as a salesperson for a local agency. I quickly discovered my passion for helping people find their dream properties and decided to become a full-fledged agent.\n\nOne of my favorite parts of this job is getting to know my clients and working with them to find the perfect piece of land. I have experience with a variety of property types and take pride in being able to find the right fit for my clients. Good communication and understanding my clients' needs and wants are key to a successful transaction, and I believe that's what sets me apart in this industry. If you're looking to buy or sell land in the Southeast, I would be more than happy to work with you.",
